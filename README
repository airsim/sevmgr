Summary:
---------
SEvMgr is a C++ library of discrete event queue management classes and
functions, exclusively targeting simulation purposes.

SEvMgr makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the 
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone ssh://denis_arnaud@git.code.sf.net/p/sevmgr/code sevmgrgit
cd sevmgrgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * stdair-devel
  * boost-devel
  * zeromq-devel
  * readline-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel (optional)
  * doxygen, ghostscript, graphviz and tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (sevmgr*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevmgr/files/

To customise the following to your environment, you can alter the path
to the installation directory:
export INSTALL_BASEDIR=/home/user/dev/deliveries
export LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE="-DLIB_SUFFIX=64"

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/sevmgr-99.99.99 \
   -DWITH_STDAIR_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/stdair-stable \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON -DENABLE_TEST:BOOL=ON \
   ${LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE} ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libsevmgr*.so*) and the binary (sevmgr),
  just type:
  make install
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the (HTML and PDF) documentation:
  make package
* To run the local binary version:
  ./sevmgr/sevmgr -b
* To run the installed version:
  ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/sevmgr-99.99.99/bin/sevmgr -b
